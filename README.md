# Emoji Spreading Discord Bot

> A Discord bot who's main functionality is to spread emoji's throughout the server by adding them to existing members names. The bot has some additional functionality for moderation, which will be expanded upon in the future.

### Dependencies

* `Python 3.9.7`
* `python3 -m pip install -U discord.py`
* `dotenv`

### How to Use

* setup a new bot at [discord/developers](https://discord.com/login?redirect_to=%2Fdevelopers%2Fapplications)
* create `.env` file
* Add your bots token in the `.env` file as `DISCORD_TOKEN=XXXXXXXX`
* run `python3 main.py`

### Admin Commands

> Admin commands will only trigger when an admin is the one giving it. Otherwise the bot will intentionally ignore it with no indication that the command exists. The settings for the server are hosted inside of a MongoDB database program. This allows the bot to be used in multiple servers, each one being able to set their own prefered emojis to spread throughout peoples names, and to have there own designated channel for the bot to forward users DM's to.
